## The Shoppie Awards
The Shoppie awards is a front end only web-app using using JavaScript to call the OMDB api allowing you to search for movies.  DOM manipulation is used to show search results and allow the user to "nominate" their 5 favorite films for the Shoppie Awards!  Developed for the Shopify UX & Web Developer Intern Challenge.

## About the Developer
Before attending Hackbright Academy, LaRena spent most of her adult life clowning around in the circus (yes, you read that right).  She studied Theatre in college and then honed her circus and clowning skills at the San Francisco Clown Conservatory.  LaRena spent 8 years touring full time in the US, Mexico and Japan with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey as well as Kinoshita Circus. Despite her passion for travel, being on the road 52 weeks a year can wear out even the most seasoned traveller.  Looking to live in one place and ready for the next step in her career, coupled with massive amounts of time in the current pandemic, LaRena discovered a love for software development and has enjoyed putting her previously unused math and logic skills to good use and learning to code.
